# PlanckLite.jl
Repository containing the data for the Planck lite likelihood.
Right now, we support only $\ell>30$ data, but we are going to add large-scale data as in [Prince & Dunkley (2022)](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.023518).


# Please cite

[*Planck* 2018 likelihood paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12875), because the high ell Planck-lite-py code is based on the public *Planck* plik-lite likelihood code and the datafiles belong to *Planck*.
